### 💡 How It Works

#### Traditional Mode
```python
# RSI-based signal generation
if rsi < 30:
    signal = "BUY"
    confidence = 70 + (30 - rsi)
elif rsi > 70:
    signal = "SELL"
    confidence = 70 + (rsi - 70)
```

#### AI Mode
```python
# Machine learning prediction
from src.ai.ai_trading_engine import AITradingPredictor
predictor = AITradingPredictor()
prediction = predictor.predict_stock_direction(price_data)
# Returns: signal, confidence, target_price, reasoning
```
